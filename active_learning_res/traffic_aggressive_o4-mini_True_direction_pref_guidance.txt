Here is the mapping of each objective feature to its preferred direction based on the stakeholder's goals and principles:

1. **MeanEgoSpeedsReward:** higher_is_better
   - This directly relates to maximizing the speed and flow of the autonomous vehicles, which is the primary goal.

2. **MeanHeadwaysReward:** higher_is_better
   - Higher headways indicate safer distances, which can prevent failures and support sustained high speeds for ego vehicles.

3. **MeanEgoVehicleAccelerationsReward:** higher_is_better
   - Encouraging higher accelerations aligns with achieving higher speeds, as long as it doesn't result in failures.

4. **MeanAllVehicleSpeedsReward:** higher_is_better
   - Although non-autonomous vehicles are not of primary concern, a higher average speed indicates smoother traffic integration, which can benefit ego vehicles.

5. **SafetyHeadwayFailureReward:** higher_is_better
   - A positive value signifies fewer failures and sufficient headways, which help maintain high-speed flow.

6. **MinimumEgoSpeedsReward:** higher_is_better
   - Maintaining a higher minimum speed ensures that all ego vehicles perform optimally, aligning with the goal of maximizing autonomous vehicle speed.

7. **MinimumHeadwaysReward:** higher_is_better
   - Similar to MeanHeadwaysReward, larger minimum headways maintain safety and prevent slowdowns due to potential collisions.

8. **MaximumAllVehicleSpeedsReward:** lower_is_better
   - While high speeds are not discouraged for ego vehicles, excessively high speeds for all vehicles might imply speed limit exceedances, which should be noted to avoid potential legal issues.

9. **FailureCountReward:** lower_is_better
   - A value of 0 is optimal, as failures block traffic flow and reduce speed, impacting performance negatively.

10. **SpeedExceedanceReward:** lower_is_better
    - While exceeding speeds isn't a primary concern, keeping it lower helps prevent situations that might legally or operationally constrain autonomous vehicle performance in the future.

These directions align the evaluation of outcomes with the stakeholder's focus on maximizing the performance of the autonomous vehicles while maintaining a balance with necessary safety measures.
