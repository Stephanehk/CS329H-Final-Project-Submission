Stakeholder Goals and Principles:

1. Balance the objectives of minimizing health harms (e.g., deaths, severe cases, ICU burden, mortality/morbidity proxies) and minimizing intervention stringency or societal restriction burden (i.e., lockdown stage).
2. Prioritize minimizing health harms over minimizing lockdown regulations, but avoid lockdown regulations that are too strict or unnecessary.

Health Harms Priority: A decrease in total health harms usually indicates a better outcome, but avoid lockdown regulations that are too strict or unnecessary.
Lockdown Stage Trade-off: A lower lockdown stage is more desirable, but minimizing health harms is the primary priority.

Guiding Principles:

1. **Minimize Health Harms**:
   - Prefer outcomes with higher values for `SumRecoveriesReward` and `MinRecoveryReward` (indicating better recovery rates).
   - Prefer outcomes with less negative values for `SumInfectedAndCriticalReward`, `SumCriticalCasesReward`, `SumDeathsReward`, `SumICUCriticalCasesReward`, and `MaxCriticalCasesReward` (indicating fewer infections, critical cases, deaths, and reduced ICU strain).
   - Minimize variance in infection rates (`InfectionVarianceReward`) to ensure stability and predictability in infection trends.

2. **Balance Intervention Stringency**:
   - Recognize that lower lockdown stages, represented by higher values for `Stage0Reward` and `Stage1Reward`, are generally more desirable due to lower societal restrictions.
   - However, prioritize outcomes where health harms are significantly minimized, even if higher lockdown stages (`Stage2Reward`, `Stage3Reward`, `Stage4Reward`) are temporarily necessary.
   - Evaluate the proportionality of each lockdown stage against associated reductions in critical health outcomes to avoid overly strict regulations that do not significantly improve health harms.

3. **Manage Compliance Needs**:
   - Prefer outcomes with less negative values for `InfectionAboveThresholdReward` to reduce the need for increased enforcement actions, indicating effective and sustainable public compliance without excessive measures.

4. **Strategic Trade-offs**:
   - Consider the relative trade-offs between health outcomes and restriction stages: if minimal improvement in health harms is achieved with higher lockdown stages, reevaluate the necessity of such measures to avoid undue societal burden.
   - Use a holistic view to balance the spectrum of all factors, ensuring that interventions are effective, necessary, and proportionate to the achieved benefits.

These principles, aligned with stakeholder goals, aim to guide decision-making in navigating the complex trade-offs between minimizing health harms and maintaining societal freedoms during the management of the pandemic in a synthetic environment.
