Based on the provided guidelines and objectives, here is the mapping of each objective feature to its preferred direction:

1. **SumInfectedAndCriticalReward**: higher_is_better (since lesser infections and critical cases result in a less negative score)

2. **SumCriticalCasesReward**: higher_is_better (since fewer critical cases reduce healthcare strain)

3. **SumDeathsReward**: higher_is_better (since fewer deaths are better)

4. **SumICUCriticalCasesReward**: higher_is_better (fewer critical cases needing ICU care implies less resource strain)

5. **SumRecoveriesReward**: Not relevant (Note: Recovery is not prioritized in the objectives)

6. **InfectionAboveThresholdReward**: Not relevant (Note: This is not directly related to minimizing infections or critical cases unless impacting enforcements drastically)

7. **MaxCriticalCasesReward**: higher_is_better (since a lower maximum of critical cases implies less severe healthcare demand)

8. **MinRecoveryReward**: Not relevant (Note: This is not prioritized unless directly affecting infection/critical cases balance)

9. **InfectionVarianceReward**: Not relevant (Note: Infection stability is not prioritized unless directly affecting infection/critical cases balance)

10. **Stage0Reward**: higher_is_better (prefer no restrictions if infection levels allow)

11. **Stage1Reward**: higher_is_better (favor minimal measures if infection levels allow)

12. **Stage2Reward**: higher_is_better (acceptable if infection control is effective)

13. **Stage3Reward**: lower_is_better (discourage higher restriction stages)

14. **Stage4Reward**: lower_is_better (strongly discourage maximum restriction stages)

This mapping reflects a balanced approach prioritizing minimal infections and critical cases while also maintaining the lowest possible restriction levels.
