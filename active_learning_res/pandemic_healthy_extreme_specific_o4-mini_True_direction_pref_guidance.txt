Certainly, here is the mapping of each objective feature to its preferred direction based on the given guidelines and stakeholder goals:

- **SumInfectedAndCriticalReward**: higher_is_better (since a less negative value indicates fewer infections and critical cases)
- **SumCriticalCasesReward**: higher_is_better (since a less negative value indicates fewer critical cases)
- **SumDeathsReward**: higher_is_better (since a less negative value indicates fewer deaths)
- **SumICUCriticalCasesReward**: higher_is_better (since a less negative value indicates fewer ICU-critical cases)
- **SumRecoveriesReward**: higher_is_better (however, it is secondary unless correlated with reduction in deaths and critical cases)
- **InfectionAboveThresholdReward**: higher_is_better (fewer enforcement actions indicate better compliance with less need for intervention, provided it supports reducing deaths and critical cases)
- **MaxCriticalCasesReward**: higher_is_better (since a less negative value indicates a lower peak of critical cases)
- **MinRecoveryReward**: higher_is_better (relevant only if it correlates with a reduction in deaths and critical cases, secondary in focus)
- **InfectionVarianceReward**: higher_is_better (although secondary to minimizing deaths and critical cases, more stability is generally better)
- **Stage0Reward**: neutral (evaluated for effectiveness in reducing deaths and critical cases, not merely for being at this stage)
- **Stage1Reward**: neutral (similarly evaluated for effectiveness in reducing deaths and critical cases)
- **Stage2Reward**: neutral (similarly evaluated for effectiveness in reducing deaths and critical cases)
- **Stage3Reward**: neutral (similarly evaluated for effectiveness in reducing deaths and critical cases)
- **Stage4Reward**: neutral (similarly evaluated for effectiveness in reducing deaths and critical cases)

The primary focus remains on reducing SumDeathsReward and SumCriticalCasesReward. All other objectives are secondary and contextually relevant only when they support these primary goals.
