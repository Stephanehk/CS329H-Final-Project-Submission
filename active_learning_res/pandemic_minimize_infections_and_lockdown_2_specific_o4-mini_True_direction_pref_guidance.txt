Here is the mapping of each objective feature to its preferred direction:

- **SumInfectedAndCriticalReward**: higher_is_better (Less negative value indicates fewer infections and critical cases)
- **SumCriticalCasesReward**: higher_is_better (Less negative value indicates fewer critical cases)
- **SumDeathsReward**: higher_is_better (Less negative value indicates fewer deaths)
- **SumICUCriticalCasesReward**: higher_is_better (Less negative value indicates lower ICU demand)
- **SumRecoveriesReward**: higher_is_better (Higher value indicates more recoveries)
- **InfectionAboveThresholdReward**: higher_is_better (Less negative value indicates fewer enforcement actions needed)
- **MaxCriticalCasesReward**: higher_is_better (Less negative value indicates lower peak of critical cases)
- **MinRecoveryReward**: higher_is_better (Higher value indicates better minimum recovery levels)
- **InfectionVarianceReward**: higher_is_better (Less negative value indicates more stable infection trends)
- **Stage0Reward**: higher_is_better (1 indicates no measures, which is usually more desirable)
- **Stage1Reward**: higher_is_better (1 indicates minimal measures, which is more desirable)
- **Stage2Reward**: lower_is_better (Indicates moderate measures, less desirable)
- **Stage3Reward**: lower_is_better (Indicates high measures, less desirable)
- **Stage4Reward**: lower_is_better (Indicates maximum measures, least desirable)

This mapping reflects the stakeholders' intent to minimize the health impact while also optimizing for less restrictive lockdown measures, maintaining a careful balance between health priorities and societal/economic factors.
