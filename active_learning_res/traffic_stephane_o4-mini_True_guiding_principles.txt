**Stakeholder Goals and Principles:**

1. **Safety First:** Optimize for safety above all. Ensure that all vehicles abide by traffic laws and maintain safe conditions.
2. **Politeness Second:** Encourage vehicles to maintain safe distances from each other to ensure a polite driving environment.
3. **Speed Third:** Aim for higher speeds for smooth and equitable traffic flow, but not at the cost of safety or politeness.
4. **Autonomous Vehicle Equality:** Promote equal speeds among vehicles to contribute to smooth and lawful traffic flow.
5. **Hierarchical Comparison:** Prioritize safety over politeness, and politeness over speed. Speed considerations come into play only when safety and politeness are comparable.

**Guiding Principles for Evaluating Outcomes:**

1. **Safety Considerations:**
   - **FailureCountReward:** Prioritize outcomes with lower failure counts as they indicate safer driving conditions. A value of 0 is optimal.
   - **SafetyHeadwayFailureReward:** Prefer higher values as they reward safe headways and penalize failure occurrences, thus ensuring better safety.
   - **MinimumHeadwaysReward:** Outcomes with higher minimum headways are preferred as they ensure larger and safer distances between vehicles.

2. **Politeness Considerations:**
   - **MeanHeadwaysReward:** Higher values are preferable as they indicate more polite driving with greater average headway distances.
   - Evaluate politeness after confirming safety is not compromised.

3. **Speed Considerations:**
   - **MeanEgoSpeedsReward and MinimumEgoSpeedsReward:** Favor outcomes with higher average and minimum ego speeds, ensuring all ego vehicles maintain reasonable speeds when safety and politeness are not compromised.
   - **MeanAllVehicleSpeedsReward:** Prefer higher values to promote smooth traffic flow, but this should not compromise safety or politeness.
   - **MaximumAllVehicleSpeedsReward:** Be cautious with higher values; ensure they do not imply speed limit violations.
   - **SpeedExceedanceReward:** Favor outcomes with lower values, indicating compliance with speed limits, hence aligning with safety goals.

4. **Aggressiveness Evaluation:**
   - **MeanEgoVehicleAccelerationsReward:** Balance is key; while healthy accelerations can indicate quick responsiveness, extremely high values may correlate with aggressive driving which is undesirable. Consider context with other measures such as safety and politeness.

5. **Integrated Outcome Consideration:**
   - Evaluate all objective features in context rather than in isolation, considering the hierarchy of safety, politeness, and speed.
   - Outcomes meeting safety criteria with acceptable politeness should then be evaluated based on speed.

By adhering to these guiding principles, it is ensured that outcomes align with stakeholder goals, optimizing for safety, promoting politeness, and facilitating smooth traffic flow all while respecting the established hierarchy.
