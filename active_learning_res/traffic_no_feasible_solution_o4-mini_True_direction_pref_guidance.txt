Based on the provided descriptions and guiding principles, here is the mapping of each objective feature to its preferred direction:

- **MeanEgoSpeedsReward**: higher_is_better (desirable for maintaining efficient speeds, provided safety is not compromised)
- **MeanHeadwaysReward**: higher_is_better (higher headway distances are preferable for safety)
- **MeanEgoVehicleAccelerationsReward**: neutral (balance between efficiency and safety needed)
- **MeanAllVehicleSpeedsReward**: higher_is_better (indicates smoother traffic flow while balancing safety and compliance)
- **SafetyHeadwayFailureReward**: higher_is_better (preferable for maintaining safe headway distances with fewer failures)
- **MinimumEgoSpeedsReward**: higher_is_better (ensures all vehicles maintain a reasonable minimum speed)
- **MinimumHeadwaysReward**: higher_is_better (indicates safer minimum distances)
- **MaximumAllVehicleSpeedsReward**: lower_is_better (prevents speed limit violations)
- **FailureCountReward**: lower_is_better (minimize occurrences of failures or collisions)
- **SpeedExceedanceReward**: lower_is_better (ensures compliance with speed limits)

Each objective is mapped according to its influence on safety, efficiency, and regulatory compliance, ensuring a balanced approach in the evaluation process.
