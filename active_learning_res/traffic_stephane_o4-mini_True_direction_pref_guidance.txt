Based on the stakeholder goals and principles outlined, here is the mapping of each objective feature to its preferred direction:

1. **MeanEgoSpeedsReward:** higher_is_better
   - Promote higher average speeds for ego vehicles, but ensure safety and politeness are not compromised first.

2. **MeanHeadwaysReward:** higher_is_better
   - Encourage greater average headway distances for safety and politeness.

3. **MeanEgoVehicleAccelerationsReward:** context-dependent
   - Balance is key; high values could indicate aggressiveness. Consider the context of other safety and politeness measures.

4. **MeanAllVehicleSpeedsReward:** higher_is_better
   - Smoother traffic flow is desirable, provided safety and politeness principles are upheld.

5. **SafetyHeadwayFailureReward:** higher_is_better
   - Higher values are preferred for maintaining safe headways and minimizing failures.

6. **MinimumEgoSpeedsReward:** higher_is_better
   - Higher minimum speeds are favorable if they do not compromise safety or politeness.

7. **MinimumHeadwaysReward:** higher_is_better
   - Larger minimum headways are preferred for safety.

8. **MaximumAllVehicleSpeedsReward:** lower_is_better
   - While higher speeds can indicate efficiency, ensuring adherence to speed limits and safety is critical.

9. **FailureCountReward:** lower_is_better
   - Lower failure counts (ideally 0) are optimal for safety.

10. **SpeedExceedanceReward:** lower_is_better
    - Lower exceedance rates, favoring compliance with speed limits, align with safety goals.

By following this mapping, evaluations will prioritize safety, encourage polite driving behavior, and support efficient traffic flow while respecting the outlined hierarchy.
