Here are the guiding principles for evaluating outcomes of different lockdown restrictions during the synthetic COVID-19 pandemic scenario:

1. **Minimize Health Impact:**
   - Prefer outcomes with higher (less negative) values for `SumInfectedAndCriticalReward`, `SumCriticalCasesReward`, `SumDeathsReward`, `SumICUCriticalCasesReward`, and `MaxCriticalCasesReward`.
   - The goal is to reduce infections, critical cases, ICU demand, and fatalities to alleviate the health system's burden and save lives.

2. **Maximize Recovery:**
   - Favor outcomes with higher values for `SumRecoveriesReward` and `MinRecoveryReward`.
   - High recovery rates indicate effective healthcare and successful disease management, leading to healthier populations.

3. **Ensure Stability:**
   - Prefer outcomes with higher (less negative) values for `InfectionVarianceReward`.
   - Steady and predictable infection trends make it easier to plan and allocate healthcare and other resources effectively.

4. **Balanced Enforcement:**
   - Minimize (less negative) values for `InfectionAboveThresholdReward`.
   - Lower enforcement actions suggest that the population is largely compliant with the ongoing measures, easing the burden on enforcement systems.

5. **Appropriate Restriction Levels:**
   - Consider the trade-offs in restriction levels based on `Stage0Reward` to `Stage4Reward`.
     - **Stage 0 (No Measures):** Ideal if infection rates are low, recovery rates are high, and healthcare systems are not strained.
     - **Stage 1 (Minimal Measures):** Suitable if minor restrictions can keep infections stable or declining without overwhelming healthcare systems.
     - **Stage 2 (Moderate Measures):** Required when infections begin to strain healthcare resources or threaten stability.
     - **Stage 3 (High Measures):** Necessary when there's a significant rise in critical cases or resource usage to protect health infrastructure.
     - **Stage 4 (Maximum Measures):** Utilized when health outcomes severely deteriorate to urgently control infections at great economic and social cost.

6. **Trade-off Considerations:**
   - Evaluate trade-offs comprehensively. For instance, Stage 4 restrictions might drastically reduce infections but may have decreased economic activity and social interaction. A balanced approach with Stage 2 or 3 measures might maintain tolerable health outcomes while preserving more normal life conditions.
  
7. **Contextual Flexibility:**
   - Adapt principles based on the specific context and time frame. Evolving data on pandemic severity, healthcare capacity, and societal needs might necessitate different priorities.

These principles aim to balance health impacts of the pandemic with social and economic considerations to determine the most desirable course of action.
