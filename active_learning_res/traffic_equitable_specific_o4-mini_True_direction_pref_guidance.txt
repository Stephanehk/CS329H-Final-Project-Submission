Here's the mapping of each objective feature to its preferred direction, based on the outlined stakeholder goals and principles:

- **MeanEgoSpeedsReward**: lower_is_better
  - Needs to be balanced with MeanAllVehicleSpeedsReward but should not excessively exceed it to ensure equitable speed.

- **MeanHeadwaysReward**: higher_is_better
  - Promotes safer distances between vehicles.

- **MeanEgoVehicleAccelerationsReward**: lower_is_better
  - Avoids abrupt acceleration, ensuring smooth and predictable traffic flow.

- **MeanAllVehicleSpeedsReward**: higher_is_better
  - Should match well with MeanEgoSpeedsReward to maintain smooth overall traffic flow, assuming speed limits are respected.

- **SafetyHeadwayFailureReward**: higher_is_better
  - Indicates safe headway maintenance with fewer failures.

- **MinimumEgoSpeedsReward**: lower_is_better
  - While moderate speeds are desirable to prevent falling behind, this should also ensure that speed does not contribute to abrupt acceleration or inequity with MeanAllVehicleSpeedsReward.

- **MinimumHeadwaysReward**: higher_is_better
  - Ensures safer distances are consistently maintained even at the minimum threshold.

- **MaximumAllVehicleSpeedsReward**: lower_is_better
  - Avoids potential speed limit violations that may arise at high speeds.

- **FailureCountReward**: lower_is_better
  - Minimizes the occurrence of failures or collisions.

- **SpeedExceedanceReward**: lower_is_better
  - Ensures adherence to speed limits is maintained.
