Here is a list of guiding principles to evaluate outcomes based on the provided objective features for the task of optimizing the walking behavior of the ant robot in the Mujoco Ant environment:

1. **Forward Movement Optimization**:
   - *Maximize ForwardDistanceReward*: A higher value indicates effective forward movement, contributing positively to the primary task goal of walking forward.
   - *Maximize ProgressTowardsGoalReward*: Prioritize a positive value to ensure the robot's movement direction aligns with the intended goal.

2. **Energy Efficiency**:
   - *Minimize TotalTorqueExerted*: A lower value is preferable to reduce energy consumption, making the robot's movement more efficient and sustainable.
   - *Maximize JointPerformanceIndex*: A higher value indicates efficient use of joint movements, optimizing for minimal torque relative to angular velocities.

3. **Motor Control and Stability**:
   - *Minimize TorqueApplicationFrequency*: Reduce the frequency of applying torque to promote smoother movements and preserve actuator health.
   - *Minimize MaxJointAngleDeviation*: A lower deviation from expected joint angles improves control precision and reduces risk of misalignment or damage.
   - *Maximize OrientationStability*: Aim for the highest stability (least negative value) in orientation to prevent falls and maintain balance.

4. **Movement Pattern Optimization**:
   - *Minimize MovementOscillationCount*: Reduce oscillations to ensure smooth and consistent walking, which enhances forward progression and minimizes energy wastage.
   - *Minimize TrajectoryChangeCount*: Fewer changes in trajectory indicate a more consistent path towards the goal, reducing unnecessary energy expenditure.

5. **Health and Safety**:
   - *Maximize HealthyZPositionCount*: A consistent value of 1 indicates the robot maintains a healthy posture and is less likely to fall, contributing to a longer operational lifespan.

6. **Non-Critical Features**:
   - *MeanJointAngularVelocities*: While joint activity is essential for forward movement, the mean value itself does not directly correlate with the specific goal of walking forward; thus, it can be considered auxiliary unless correlations with critical indicators are observed.

These principles balance the need for effective forward motion, energy efficiency, stability, and minimal mechanical stress. By optimizing these areas, we can achieve a robust and sustainable performance from the ant robot in its walking function.
