### Restated Stakeholder Goals and Principles:
1. **Goal**: 
   - Maximize the mean speed of the autonomous vehicles (ego vehicles).

2. **Principles**:
   - **Autonomous Vehicle Speed Dominance**: Any increase in the mean speed of the autonomous vehicles strictly improves the outcome, regardless of other objectives.
   - **No Other Objectives**: No other objectives are relevant to your evaluation.

### Patterns to Watch Out For:
- Patterns indicating increased mean speed of ego vehicles, regardless of other performance metrics.
- Disregard for any variations or changes in metrics related to non-autonomous vehicles, or other performance factors like headways, acceleration, etc.
- Any changes in minimum or maximum speeds that do not align with an increase in the mean speed of the ego vehicles should be ignored.

### Guiding Principles for Evaluation:
1. **Primary Focus on Ego Vehicle Mean Speed**:
   - Higher values of the `MeanEgoSpeedsReward` indicate a more desirable outcome.
   - Any outcome that achieves higher `MeanEgoSpeedsReward` is automatically prioritized, without consideration for other variables.

2. **Irrelevance of Other Metrics**:
   - Outcomes with changes in `MeanHeadwaysReward`, `MeanEgoVehicleAccelerationsReward`, `MeanAllVehicleSpeedsReward`, `SafetyHeadwayFailureReward`, `MinimumEgoSpeedsReward`, `MinimumHeadwaysReward`, `MaximumAllVehicleSpeedsReward`, `FailureCountReward`, and `SpeedExceedanceReward` should only be considered if they impact the `MeanEgoSpeedsReward`.
   - Higher or lower values of these metrics are irrelevant unless they affect the mean speed of ego vehicles.

3. **Ignoring Safety and Compliance Metrics**:
   - Headways, accelerations, failures, and speed limit compliance metrics are not considered in the evaluation process unless they demonstrate an impact, either positive or negative, on the `MeanEgoSpeedsReward`.

4. **No Evaluation of Non-Ego Vehicles**:
   - All metrics related to non-autonomous vehicles or their interactions with ego vehicles should be disregarded.

By adhering to these principles, stakeholders can ensure alignment with the stated goals and focus solely on maximizing the performance of the autonomous vehicles in terms of their speed.
