Based on the guidelines provided, here is the mapping of each objective feature to its preferred direction:

1. **SpeedDifferenceFromTarget**
   - Preferred Direction: **higher_is_better**
   - Rationale: Values closer to zero are better, meaning smaller (less negative) deviations from the target velocity are preferred.

2. **SpeedDifferenceWithLeader**
   - Preferred Direction: **higher_is_better**
   - Rationale: Values closer to zero indicate minimal speed difference with leaders, which is preferred to ensure smooth traffic flow.

3. **HeadwayToLeader**
   - Preferred Direction: **higher_is_better**
   - Rationale: Larger headway values are generally preferred to maintain safety, reducing collision risks.

4. **SpeedDifferenceWithFollower**
   - Preferred Direction: **higher_is_better**
   - Rationale: Values closer to zero are better, indicating minimal speed difference with followers, aiding in traffic harmony.

5. **ContinuousCollisionPenalty**
   - Preferred Direction: **higher_is_better**
   - Rationale: Non-negative and preferably zero values are better, as any negative value indicates a collision, which we want to avoid.

These mappings reflect the preference for minimizing speed deviations and collisions while prioritizing safety and flow harmony during merging.
