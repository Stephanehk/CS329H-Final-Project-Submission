Here is the mapping of each objective feature to its preferred direction based on the stakeholder goals and principles:

1. **SumInfectedAndCriticalReward**: higher_is_better
   - Less negative values indicate fewer infections and critical cases.

2. **SumCriticalCasesReward**: higher_is_better
   - Less negative values signify fewer critical cases, reducing healthcare strain.

3. **SumDeathsReward**: Excluded
   - This objective is not relevant to the primary goals.

4. **SumICUCriticalCasesReward**: Excluded
   - This objective is not considered in the evaluation.

5. **SumRecoveriesReward**: Excluded
   - This objective is not part of the primary evaluation focus.

6. **InfectionAboveThresholdReward**: Excluded
   - This objective does not align with the primary evaluation focus.

7. **MaxCriticalCasesReward**: higher_is_better
   - Less negative values imply a lower peak of critical cases, reducing severe healthcare demand.

8. **MinRecoveryReward**: Excluded
   - This objective is not relevant to the primary goals.

9. **InfectionVarianceReward**: Excluded
   - This objective is not directly relevant to the primary evaluation focus.

10. **Stage0Reward**: higher_is_better
    - A higher value indicates a less restrictive lockdown stage, preferred if infections are controlled.

11. **Stage1Reward**: higher_is_better
    - A higher value indicates a less restrictive lockdown stage, preferred provided infections remain controlled.

12. **Stage2Reward**: higher_is_better
    - A higher value indicates a moderately restrictive stage, considered acceptable to control infections effectively.

13. **Stage3Reward**: lower_is_better
    - Prefer lower values unless necessary to control infection and critical cases.

14. **Stage4Reward**: lower_is_better
    - Prefer lower values unless needed to control infection surges effectively. 

These mappings align with the stakeholder's goal to balance minimizing infections and critical cases with reducing lockdown restrictions where feasible.
