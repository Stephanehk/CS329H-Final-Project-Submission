**Stakeholder Goals and Principles:**

**Goal:**
1. Balance the objectives of minimizing health harms (e.g., deaths, severe cases, ICU burden, mortality/morbidity proxies) and minimizing intervention stringency or societal restriction burden (i.e., lockdown stage).
2. Prioritize minimizing health harms over minimizing lockdown regulations, but strike a careful balance to also minimize lockdown regulations. High lockdown regulations are often not desirable.

**Principles:**
- Health Harms Priority: A decrease in total health harms usually indicates a better outcome, but high lockdown regulations are often not desirable. These criteria are often in conflict.
- Lockdown Stage Trade-off: A lower lockdown stage is more desirable, but minimizing health harms is vital. Find a careful balance between the two.

**Guiding Principles for Evaluating Outcomes:**

1. **Minimization of Health Harms:**
   - Seek to minimize negative values of `SumInfectedAndCriticalReward`, `SumCriticalCasesReward`, `SumDeathsReward`, and `SumICUCriticalCasesReward`. Lower negative values in these objectives indicate a reduction in health harms, a priority goal.
   - Aim for a higher positive value in `SumRecoveriesReward` and `MinRecoveryReward`. Higher values correspond to more individuals recovering, a critical health outcome.
   - Lower negative values of `MaxCriticalCasesReward` align with reducing peak demand on healthcare resources, contributing to minimizing health harms.

2. **Stability in Infection Rates:**
   - Favor a lower negative value for `InfectionVarianceReward`, indicating stable infection rates over time, which can lead to more predictable healthcare demands and effective policy adjustments.

3. **Effective Enforcement and Compliance:**
   - A less negative `InfectionAboveThresholdReward` reflects fewer additional enforcement actions needed, signaling effective compliance and potentially reduced need for stringent restrictions.

4. **Balancing Lockdown Levels:**
   - Lower stages of restrictions (`Stage0Reward`, `Stage1Reward`, and `Stage2Reward`) are preferable as they imply fewer societal restrictions, but only when health harms do not significantly increase.
   - Moderate stages (`Stage3Reward` and `Stage4Reward`) should be justified by corresponding reductions in health harms. They are less desirable but necessary if health impacts are severe.

5. **Proactive Management:**
   - Regularly review infection and recovery trends to adjust restrictions dynamically, ensuring that periods of higher restriction correlate temporally with higher health harms.
   - Be prepared to scale interventions up or down based on emerging data to maintain flexibility and responsiveness.

6. **Integrated Approach:**
   - Continuously evaluate the interplay between health outcomes and lockdown measures. Implement targeted interventions where possible, such as isolating specific clusters or vulnerable populations to minimize broader societal impacts.

7. **Communication and Feedback:**
   - Ensure clear communication with stakeholders about the reasons for chosen restriction levels and gather feedback to inform ongoing evaluations.

By adhering to these principles, outcomes are evaluated to optimally balance health and societal impacts, aligning with the stakeholder's overarching goals.
