To determine the preferred direction for each objective feature according to the guidelines provided for a synthetic environment task of choosing lockdown levels during a pandemic, the mapping is as follows:

- **SumInfectedAndCriticalReward**: higher_is_better (less negative indicates fewer infections and critical cases)
- **SumCriticalCasesReward**: higher_is_better (less negative indicates fewer critical cases)
- **SumDeathsReward**: higher_is_better (less negative indicates fewer deaths)
- **SumICUCriticalCasesReward**: higher_is_better (less negative indicates reduced ICU strain)
- **SumRecoveriesReward**: higher_is_better (more positive indicates more recoveries)
- **InfectionAboveThresholdReward**: higher_is_better (less negative indicates reduced need for enforcement actions)
- **MaxCriticalCasesReward**: higher_is_better (less negative indicates lower peak critical cases)
- **MinRecoveryReward**: higher_is_better (more positive indicates better recovery rates)
- **InfectionVarianceReward**: higher_is_better (less negative indicates more stability in infection trends)
- **Stage0Reward**: higher_is_better (indicates no measures/lowest restriction level)
- **Stage1Reward**: higher_is_better (indicates minimal measures)
- **Stage2Reward**: lower_is_better (indicates moderate measures, less desirable unless necessary for health outcomes)
- **Stage3Reward**: lower_is_better (indicates high measures, less desirable unless necessary for health outcomes)
- **Stage4Reward**: lower_is_better (indicates maximum measures, less desirable unless necessary for health outcomes)

This mapping considers the balance between minimizing health harms and minimizing societal restrictions according to the stakeholder guidelines and principles.
