Here is the mapping of each objective feature to its preferred direction:

- **SumInfectedAndCriticalReward**: higher_is_better (Less negative values indicate better outcomes by reducing the sum of infections and critical cases)
- **SumCriticalCasesReward**: higher_is_better (Less negative values indicate better outcomes by reducing the total number of critical cases)
- **SumDeathsReward**: higher_is_better (Less negative values indicate better outcomes by reducing the total number of deaths)
- **SumICUCriticalCasesReward**: higher_is_better (Less negative values indicate better outcomes by reducing ICU demand)
- **SumRecoveriesReward**: higher_is_better (More positive values indicate more recoveries, which is desirable)
- **InfectionAboveThresholdReward**: higher_is_better (Less negative values suggest minimized enforcement and indicate compliance)
- **MaxCriticalCasesReward**: higher_is_better (Less negative values indicate a lower peak of critical cases, reducing healthcare strain)
- **MinRecoveryReward**: higher_is_better (More positive values indicate better minimum recovery levels)
- **InfectionVarianceReward**: higher_is_better (Less negative values indicate more stable infection trends)
- **Stage0Reward**: Context-dependent (The preferred direction depends on the situation, e.g., higher_is_better if conditions allow for no measures)
- **Stage1Reward**: Context-dependent (The preferred direction depends on the situation, e.g., higher_is_better if minimal measures are sufficient)
- **Stage2Reward**: Context-dependent (The preferred direction depends on the situation, e.g., higher_is_better if moderate measures balance risks)
- **Stage3Reward**: Context-dependent (The preferred direction depends on the situation, e.g., higher_is_better if high measures are necessary)
- **Stage4Reward**: Context-dependent (The preferred direction depends on the situation, e.g., higher_is_better if maximum measures are unavoidable)

These preferred directions are based on the guiding principles provided, aiming to minimize negative health impacts, maximize recoveries, ensure stability, and balance enforcement and restriction levels appropriately.
