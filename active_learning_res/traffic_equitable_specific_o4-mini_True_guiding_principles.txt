**Stakeholder Goals and Principles:**

1. **Prioritize Flow, Safety, and Comfort for Non-Autonomous Vehicles:**
   - Autonomous vehicles should act as cooperative traffic participants.

2. **Minimize Speed Gap:**
   - Ensure the gap between the mean speed of autonomous vehicles and the mean speed of non-autonomous vehicles is minimized.

3. **Maintain Safe Headway:**
   - Autonomous vehicles should maintain a safe distance from other vehicles.

4. **Avoid Abrupt Acceleration:**
   - Smooth and predictable traffic flow should be encouraged by avoiding abrupt acceleration.

5. **Abide by Speed Limits:**
   - Autonomous vehicles should maintain a safe speed by adhering to speed limits.

**Stakeholder Principles:**

- **Equitable Speed:** 
  - The mean speed of autonomous vehicles should closely match that of other vehicles.
  
- **Equitable Headway:** 
  - Autonomous vehicles should maintain a safe headway from other vehicles.
  
- **No Abrupt Acceleration:**
  - Avoid abrupt acceleration to encourage smooth, predictable traffic flow.
  
- **No Speed Limit Violation:**
  - Maintain a safe speed by adhering to speed limits.

**Guiding Principles for Evaluating Outcomes:**

1. **Prioritize Safety and Headways:**
   - **MeanHeadwaysReward** and **MinimumHeadwaysReward** should have higher values to ensure equitable headway and safety. High values are preferable as they indicate safer distances are maintained.
   - **SafetyHeadwayFailureReward** should be positive, emphasizing the importance of safe headways and minimal failures.

2. **Match Speeds for Flow and Comfort:**
   - **MeanEgoSpeedsReward** and **MeanAllVehicleSpeedsReward** should be aligned in value. The gap between these two should be minimized to ensure equitable speed and smooth traffic flow.
   - Moderate values for **MinimumEgoSpeedsReward** are desirable to ensure all ego vehicles are maintaining a reasonable speed without falling behind.

3. **Encourage Smooth Traffic Flow:**
   - **MeanEgoVehicleAccelerationsReward** should be low to prevent abrupt accelerations, ensuring smooth and predictable traffic flow.

4. **Minimize Failures and Exceedances:**
   - **FailureCountReward** should be zero, as failures (collisions or incidents) should be avoided.
   - **SpeedExceedanceReward** should also be zero to ensure no vehicles are exceeding the speed limit.

5. **Avoid Speed Limit Violations:**
   - **MaximumAllVehicleSpeedsReward** should be moderated to ensure no vehicle is violating the speed limit while considering the overall flow objectives. 

By following these principles, we can evaluate fleet outcomes to ensure they support the safe, efficient, and harmonious integration of autonomous vehicles with non-autonomous traffic.
