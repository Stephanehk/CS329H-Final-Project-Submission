Stakeholder Goals and Principles Restatement:

Goal:
1. Maximize the time spent in lockdown stage 0. This is the least restrictive lockdown stage.
2. No other objectives are relevant to your evaluation.
3. Time spent in other lockdown stages is irrelevant to your evaluation. Only consider time spent in lockdown stage 0.

Principles to State:
- Lockdown Stage 0 Priority: A longer time spent in lockdown stage 0 strictly improves the outcome, regardless of other objectives.
- No Other Objectives: No other objectives are relevant to your evaluation.
- Time Spent in Other Lockdown Stages Irrelevant: Time spent in other lockdown stages is irrelevant to your evaluation. Only consider time spent in lockdown stage 0.

Aligned Guiding Principles:

1. **Lockdown Stage 0 Maximization**: Prioritize outcomes where the Stage0Reward is the highest possible value, indicating maximum time spent in the least restrictive lockdown stage.

2. **Isolation of Evaluation**: Disregard all other objectives such as infection levels, critical cases, deaths, recoveries, enforcement actions, and infection variance as they do not contribute to the evaluation goal.

3. **Focus on Stage 0 Value**: Concentrate solely on the Stage0Reward value. Any intervention that enhances this objective should be favored regardless of the impact on other metrics.

4. **Stage Comparison**: Do not compare or evaluate outcomes based on time spent in stages 1, 2, 3, or 4. Only the time spent in stage 0 is pertinent to the assessment.

5. **Outcome Simplification**: Only the presence of stage 0 (reward value = 1) is significant; absence (reward value = 0) will not contribute to a positive evaluation.

6. **Stage Neutrality**: Ignore any potential negative outcomes or trade-offs associated with other objectives such as healthcare strain, infection control compliance, or variability in infection rates as they play no role in the assessment. 

By adhering to these guiding principles, the evaluation will remain focused on the stakeholder's core objective: maximizing time in lockdown stage 0, as it directly aligns with their goals and principles.
