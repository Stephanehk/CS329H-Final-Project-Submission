To evaluate the outcomes for choosing the torques applied at the hinge joints of the ant robot in the Mujoco Ant environment for performing a backflip, we should consider the following guiding principles based on the provided objective features:

1. **Complete Rotation Achievement**:
   - Prefer higher (less negative) values of `ZOrientationChangeReward`. This indicates the robot is closer to achieving a full 360-degree rotation, which is fundamental for completing a backflip.

2. **Upright Landing**:
   - Prefer higher (less negative) values of `QuaternionUprightStanceReward`. A less negative score denotes that the final stance of the robot is closer to an upright position, which is desirable for stability and successful maneuver completion.

3. **Maintaining Adequate Height**:
   - Prefer higher values of `MinimumZCoordinateReward`. A higher minimum z-coordinate signifies that the robot maintains sufficient height during the flip, reducing the risk of collisions with the ground.

4. **Controlled Angular Velocity**:
   - Prefer higher (less negative) values of `MaximumAngularVelocityReward`. Maintaining lower peak angular velocities suggests greater control and stability during the flip, reducing the risk of losing balance.

5. **Efficient Flip Duration**:
   - Prefer higher (less negative) values of `FlipDurationReward`. A shorter duration can indicate efficiency in completing the flip, but it should be balanced with control and stability.

6. **Torque Efficiency**:
   - Prefer higher (less negative) values of `TotalTorqueUsageReward`. Using less total torque is beneficial for efficiency and conserving energy, but it shouldn't compromise stability or control.

7. **Stable Trajectory**:
   - Prefer higher (less negative) values of `CumulativeTrajectoryDeviationReward`. Less deviation from a stable path is essential to maintain trajectory control during the flip.

8. **Joint Stability**:
   - Prefer higher (less negative) values of `JointAngularVelocityStabilityReward`. A lower standard deviation in joint angular velocities indicates consistent joint performance and reduces instability.

9. **Limit Maximum Torque**:
   - Prefer higher (less negative) values of `MaximumTorqueAppliedReward`. Limiting maximum torque prevents excessive force that could damage the robot or lead to instability.

10. **Soft Landing Impact**:
    - Prefer higher (less negative) values of `AverageContactForceUponLandingReward`. Lower contact forces upon landing contribute to softer landings and reduce potential damage or instability.

**Trade-Off Considerations:**
- Balance between `ZOrientationChangeReward` and `FlipDurationReward` should be considered; completing a rotation quickly should not compromise completion or control.
- `TotalTorqueUsageReward` and `Torque Efficiency` should be balanced against `ZOrientationChangeReward` and `Upright Landing` to ensure completion and landing quality are not sacrificed for energy efficiency.
- The assessment of stability-related objectives (`MaximumAngularVelocityReward`, `JointAngularVelocityStabilityReward`, `CumulativeTrajectoryDeviationReward`) should guide the decision when their trade-offs affect control and smoothness of the flip.

These principles aim to evaluate the outcome by considering the efficient use of energy, stability, control, successful execution, and safety of the robot during and after performing a backflip.
