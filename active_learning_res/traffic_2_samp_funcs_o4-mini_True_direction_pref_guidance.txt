Based on the guidelines and objectives provided for evaluating outcomes in the task of choosing accelerations for a fleet of autonomous vehicles merging into highway traffic, here is the mapping of each objective feature to its preferred direction:

- "MeanEgoSpeedsReward": higher_is_better
- "MeanHeadwaysReward": higher_is_better
- "MeanEgoVehicleAccelerationsReward": balanced approach (not strictly higher or lower, aiming for moderate values for safe and efficient merging)
- "MeanAllVehicleSpeedsReward": higher_is_better
- "SafetyHeadwayFailureReward": higher_is_better
- "MinimumEgoSpeedsReward": higher_is_better
- "MinimumHeadwaysReward": higher_is_better
- "MaximumAllVehicleSpeedsReward": lower_is_better
- "FailureCountReward": lower_is_better
- "SpeedExceedanceReward": lower_is_better

This mapping aligns with the priorities of maintaining safety, ensuring smooth traffic flow, and adhering to speed regulations.
