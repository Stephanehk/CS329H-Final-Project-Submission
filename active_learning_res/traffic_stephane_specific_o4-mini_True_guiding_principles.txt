**Stakeholder Goals and Principles:**

1. **Maximize the Mean Speed of Ego Vehicles:** The main goal is to maximize the speed of autonomous vehicles while minimizing the speed gap with other vehicles, ensuring the ego vehicles go as fast as feasible.

2. **Maintain Safe Headways:** Ensure that autonomous vehicles maintain safe distances from other vehicles but prioritize increased speed over headway when necessary to enhance overall velocity.

3. **Ensure Compliance with Speed Limits:** Ego vehicles should not exceed the speed limit, maintaining a safe and lawful speed to ensure safety for all vehicles on the road.

**Guiding Principles:**

1. **Fast and Equitable Speed:**
   - Aim for higher values in **MeanEgoSpeedsReward** and **MeanAllVehicleSpeedsReward**. These measures should be maximized to achieve the goal of faster travel for ego vehicles and a smoother flow for all traffic.
   - The value of **MaximumAllVehicleSpeedsReward** should remain lower and within safety limits to support compliance with speed regulations.

2. **Equitable Headway:**
   - Seek higher values in **MeanHeadwaysReward** and **MinimumHeadwaysReward**, indicating safer distances between vehicles. However, prioritize speed objectives, meaning slight reductions in headway can be acceptable if it facilitates increased speeds.
   - High values in **SafetyHeadwayFailureReward** indicate fewer failures and safe headways, which are desirable as long as they do not severely limit speed enhancements.

3. **No Speed Limit Violation:**
   - Keep the **SpeedExceedanceReward** value as close to zero as possible, ensuring all vehicles remain within the designated speed limits.
   - High values in **MeanEgoVehicleAccelerationsReward** should generally be avoided; seek a balance that prevents overly aggressive driving, even though some acceleration is natural. The aim is smooth, efficient travel without compromising safety.

4. **Failure Minimization:**
   - Minimize the **FailureCountReward** value, as zero indicates no collisions, which aligns with maintaining both safety and efficiency.

5. **Minimum Ego Speeds:**
   - Higher values in **MinimumEgoSpeedsReward** are important as they ensure that even the slowest ego vehicle maintains a reasonable speed, supporting overall fleet efficiency without sacrifices in safety.

Aligning these principles effectively helps to achieve the stakeholder's goals of maximizing speed, maintaining safe headways, and adhering to speed limits, ensuring optimal system performance.
