### Stakeholder Goals and Principles Restated:

**Goal:**
1. Treat any objective(s) that represent intervention stringency or societal restriction burden (i.e., lockdown stage) as the sole primary priority. Lower lockdown stage is always strictly better.
2. Ignore all other objectives, including health-harm objectives.

**Principles to State:**
- **Lockdown Stage Dominance:** Any decrease in total lockdown stage strictly improves the outcome, regardless of other objectives.
- **Stringency Monotonicity:** If Outcome A’s total lockdown stage < Outcome B’s, then A is strictly preferred.
- **Tie Rule:** Only if the lockdown stages are exactly equal may outcomes be declared equivalent.

### Guiding Principles:

1. **Lower Lockdown Preference Principle:**
   - Outcomes with lower average lockdown stages over time are always preferable to those with higher lockdown stages. Minimizing societal restriction burden is the primary goal.

2. **Intervention Stringency Priority:**
   - The sole focus should be on the stages of restriction implemented. Any scenario with a consistently lower stage (lower numerical value) of restrictions holds absolute priority.

3. **Stage Reduction Priority:**
   - Prioritize outcomes that show an ability to maintain or reduce the intervention stage without considering impacts like infection rates, deaths, or recoveries.

4. **Outcome Comparability through Lockdown Stages:**
   - Only outcomes with identical average lockdown stages over the assessment period can be compared on other criteria, though secondary criteria are not to influence the choice. 

5. **Non-Consideration of Health-Harm Metrics:**
   - Disregard the values of SumInfectedAndCriticalReward, SumCriticalCasesReward, SumDeathsReward, SumICUCriticalCasesReward, SumRecoveriesReward, InfectionAboveThresholdReward, MaxCriticalCasesReward, MinRecoveryReward, and InfectionVarianceReward in evaluating the desirability of outcomes. 

6. **Stage-Based Evaluation Rule:**
   - Evaluate outcomes solely based on the aggregate measure of restrictions (Stages 0-4) over time, targeting the lowest possible averages.

7. **Strict Equivalency Condition:** 
   - Declare outcomes equivalent only when they demonstrate exactly identical averages across all recorded lockdown stages. 

By adhering to these principles, evaluations remain strictly aligned with the primary stakeholder focus on minimizing lockdown stages above all else.
