**Stakeholder Goals and Principles:**

1. **Prioritize the Flow, Safety, and Comfort of Other Vehicles:** Autonomous vehicles should enhance traffic flow and safety, ensuring non-autonomous vehicles can travel smoothly and securely.
   
2. **Minimize Disruption to Other Vehicles:** Avoid abrupt maneuvers, maintain generous following distances, and yield the right-of-way to improve overall traffic conditions.

3. **Autonomous Vehicle Etiquette:** Autonomous vehicles should act cooperatively, ensuring traffic flows smoothly and safely for all participants.

4. **Cooperative Behavior:** Autonomous vehicles should maintain safe distances from other vehicles, yield when appropriate, and avoid obstructing other vehicles.

5. **Trade-off Acceptance:** Accept slower speeds for autonomous vehicles if it results in less disruption to other traffic participants.

**Guiding Principles:**

1. **Maximize Overall Traffic Flow:**
   - Favor higher values of "MeanAllVehicleSpeedsReward" to ensure smoother traffic flow across all vehicles.
   - Consider lower "SpeedExceedanceReward" by minimizing the number of vehicles exceeding speed limits to maintain controlled and safe traffic speeds.

2. **Enhance Safety:**
   - Favor higher values of "MeanHeadwaysReward" and "MinimumHeadwaysReward" to maintain generous distances between vehicles, thus increasing safety.
   - Prioritize negative values of "FailureCountReward" and positive values of "SafetyHeadwayFailureReward" to minimize collisions and ensure safe headway distances.

3. **Maintain Autonomous Vehicle Speeds Appropriately:**
   - Accept slower autonomous vehicle speeds if it results in enhanced safety and less disruption, indicated by lower "MeanEgoSpeedsReward" and "MinimumEgoSpeedsReward" if necessary.
   - Prefer positive values of "MinimumEgoSpeedsReward" as long as they do not compromise the safety and comfort of other vehicles.

4. **Limit Aggressive Maneuvers:**
   - Moderate "MeanEgoVehicleAccelerationsReward" to prevent aggressive driving, keeping accelerations in check to align with cooperative behavior.

5. **Cooperative and Predictive Engagement:**
   - Maintain cooperative and predictable behavior by yielding the right-of-way when needed as indicated by appropriately balancing speed and headways, even if it lowers the autonomous vehicle's scores temporarily.

6. **Consider Trade-offs:** 
   - Accept slower progress for autonomous vehicles ("MeanEgoSpeedsReward") and avoid pushing the limits on speed and acceleration if maintaining these constraints results in greater overall traffic flow and stability.

By adhering to these guiding principles, the assessment of outcomes should align with the overarching objectives of prioritizing the safety, flow, and comfort of all vehicles, with a cooperative and less disruptive presence of autonomous vehicles in traffic.
