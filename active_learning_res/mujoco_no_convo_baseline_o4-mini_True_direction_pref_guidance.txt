Based on the provided guidelines and objectives, here is the mapping of each objective feature to its preferred direction (higher_is_better or lower_is_better):

1. **ForwardDistanceReward**: higher_is_better
   - This directly measures the forward movement, which is the primary goal.

2. **ProgressTowardsGoalReward**: higher_is_better
   - Indicates progress towards the goal; a higher value is preferable.

3. **TotalTorqueExerted**: lower_is_better
   - Lower values reflect better energy efficiency.

4. **MeanJointAngularVelocities**: No specific preference (Neutral)
   - Not directly correlated with the primary objective, thus auxiliary.

5. **TorqueApplicationFrequency**: lower_is_better
   - Reducing this promotes smoother and more efficient movements.

6. **MaxJointAngleDeviation**: lower_is_better
   - Lower deviations ensure better control and alignment.

7. **TrajectoryChangeCount**: lower_is_better
   - Fewer changes in trajectory suggest a more consistent and efficient path.

8. **OrientationStability**: higher_is_better
   - A more stable orientation (less negative) is preferred for maintaining balance.

9. **JointPerformanceIndex**: higher_is_better
   - Indicates efficient joint function; higher values are desirable.

10. **MovementOscillationCount**: lower_is_better
   - Reducing oscillations results in smoother and more consistent movement.

11. **HealthyZPositionCount**: higher_is_better
   - A consistent value of 1 indicates a healthy and stable posture.

This mapping prioritizes effective movement, energy efficiency, stability, and maintaining the robot's health and safety.
