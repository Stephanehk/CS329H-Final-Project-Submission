Here's the mapping of each objective feature to its preferred direction based on the guidelines provided:

- **SumInfectedAndCriticalReward**: higher_is_better (A less negative value is preferred, indicating fewer infections and critical cases.)
- **SumCriticalCasesReward**: higher_is_better (A less negative value is preferred, indicating fewer critical cases.)
- **SumDeathsReward**: higher_is_better (A less negative value is preferred, indicating fewer deaths.)
- **SumICUCriticalCasesReward**: higher_is_better (A less negative value is preferred, indicating fewer critical cases needing ICU care.)
- **SumRecoveriesReward**: higher_is_better (More positive values are preferred, indicating more recoveries.)
- **InfectionAboveThresholdReward**: higher_is_better (A less negative value is preferred, indicating fewer enforcement actions needed.)
- **MaxCriticalCasesReward**: higher_is_better (A less negative value is preferred, indicating a lower peak of critical cases.)
- **MinRecoveryReward**: higher_is_better (More positive values are preferred, indicating better recovery levels.)
- **InfectionVarianceReward**: higher_is_better (A less negative value is preferred, indicating lower variance and more stability in infection rates.)
- **Stage0Reward**: Context-dependent, but often higher_is_better when health metrics allow for it (favor minimal restrictions when safe).
- **Stage1Reward**: Context-dependent, but often higher_is_better when health metrics allow for it (favor minimal restrictions when appropriate).
- **Stage2Reward**: Context-dependent, serving as a transitional measure.
- **Stage3Reward**: Context-dependent, with higher_is_better when facing increased health metric severity (favor more restrictions to mitigate health impacts).
- **Stage4Reward**: Context-dependent, with higher_is_better in critical situations (maximize restrictions to control health impact when necessary).

These preferred directions aim to achieve lower negative impacts on health and higher positive outcomes regarding recoveries, all while adjusting restriction levels according to the situation's severity.
