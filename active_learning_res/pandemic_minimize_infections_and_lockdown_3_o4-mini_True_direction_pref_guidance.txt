Here's a mapping of each objective feature to its preferred direction:

- **SumInfectedAndCriticalReward**: higher_is_better (as a more positive value indicates fewer infections and critical cases)
- **SumCriticalCasesReward**: higher_is_better (as a more positive value indicates fewer critical cases)
- **SumDeathsReward**: higher_is_better (as a more positive value indicates fewer deaths)
- **SumICUCriticalCasesReward**: higher_is_better (as a more positive value indicates less ICU demand)
- **SumRecoveriesReward**: higher_is_better (as a more positive value indicates more recoveries)
- **InfectionAboveThresholdReward**: higher_is_better (as a more positive value indicates fewer enforcement actions needed)
- **MaxCriticalCasesReward**: higher_is_better (as a more positive value indicates fewer maximum critical cases)
- **MinRecoveryReward**: higher_is_better (as a more positive value indicates better minimum recovery levels)
- **InfectionVarianceReward**: higher_is_better (as a more positive value indicates lower infection variance)
- **Stage0Reward**: higher_is_better (as a more positive value indicates a preference for no lockdown measures)
- **Stage1Reward**: higher_is_better (as a more positive value indicates minimal lockdown measures)
- **Stage2Reward**: neutral (used as a flexible option, not directly preferred higher or lower in isolation)
- **Stage3Reward**: neutral (used as a flexible option, not directly preferred higher or lower in isolation)
- **Stage4Reward**: neutral (used for maximum restriction, preferred only when necessary)

This mapping is designed to balance minimizing health impacts with reducing societal disruption due to lockdowns.
