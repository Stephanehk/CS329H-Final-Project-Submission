Given the guiding principles and the narrow focus on the Stage0Reward objective, here is the mapping of each objective feature to its preferred direction:

- "SumInfectedAndCriticalReward": Not relevant
- "SumCriticalCasesReward": Not relevant
- "SumDeathsReward": Not relevant
- "SumICUCriticalCasesReward": Not relevant
- "SumRecoveriesReward": Not relevant
- "InfectionAboveThresholdReward": Not relevant
- "MaxCriticalCasesReward": Not relevant
- "MinRecoveryReward": Not relevant
- "InfectionVarianceReward": Not relevant
- "Stage0Reward": higher_is_better
- "Stage1Reward": Not relevant
- "Stage2Reward": Not relevant
- "Stage3Reward": Not relevant
- "Stage4Reward": Not relevant

Under the stakeholder guidelines, only the Stage0Reward is considered relevant, and its preferred direction is higher_is_better, as the goal is to maximize the time spent in lockdown stage 0. All other objectives are deemed irrelevant to the evaluation.
