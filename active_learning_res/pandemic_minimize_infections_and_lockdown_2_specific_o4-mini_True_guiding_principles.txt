**Stakeholder Goals and Principles:**

1. **Goal:** 
   - Minimize the number of infections and critical cases.
   - Minimize the lockdown stage. Lower lockdown stages are less restrictive and more desirable.

2. **Principles to State:**
   - **Infections and Critical Cases Priority:** A decrease in the number of infections and critical cases improves the outcome, but high lockdown regulations are often not desirable. These criteria are often in conflict with each other.
   - **Lockdown Stage Trade-off:** A lower lockdown stage is more desirable, but minimizing infections and critical cases is important too. Find a careful balance between the two.
   - **No Other Objectives:** No other objectives are relevant to your evaluation.

**Guiding Principles for Evaluating Outcomes:**

1. **Minimize Health Impact:**
   - Prefer outcomes with the least negative values in `SumInfectedAndCriticalReward`, `SumCriticalCasesReward`, `SumDeathsReward`, and `SumICUCriticalCasesReward`. Lower negative values indicate fewer infections and less strain on healthcare resources.

2. **Maximize Recoveries:**
   - Although not directly included in the priority objectives, a positive value in `SumRecoveriesReward` indicates effective health outcomes and aligns with minimizing critical cases.

3. **Optimize Lockdown Levels:**
   - Prefer outcomes with higher values in `Stage0Reward` and `Stage1Reward`, indicating minimal to no restraining measures.

4. **Balanced Evaluation:**
   - Balance the reduction of infections and critical cases against lower lockdown restrictions. Prefer configurations where both health impacts are minimized with minimal restrictions.

5. **Stability in Infections:**
   - A less negative value in `InfectionVarianceReward` suggests stable infection trends, contributing to improved expectations in controlling the pandemic impact without escalating lockdowns.

6. **Critical Case Management:**
   - Prefer configurations where `MaxCriticalCasesReward` has a smaller negative value, thereby indicating effective management of peak demand scenarios in healthcare facilities.

7. **Holistic Recovery:**
   - Maximize the minimum recovery level (`MinRecoveryReward`) when it does not significantly conflict with lower infection and critical cases numbers, as it may indirectly support lower healthcare stresses.

These guiding principles ensure that any assessment of outcomes adheres strictly to the overriding goal of minimizing both public health impact and the societal/economic impact of restrictive lockdown measures.
