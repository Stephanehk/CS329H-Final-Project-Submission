Here's the preferred direction for each objective feature based on the given stakeholder goals and principles:

- **MeanEgoSpeedsReward**: lower_is_better  
  Rationale: Slower autonomous vehicle speeds are acceptable if they result in enhanced safety and less disruption.

- **MeanHeadwaysReward**: higher_is_better  
  Rationale: Larger headway distances are preferred to enhance safety by maintaining generous distances between vehicles.

- **MeanEgoVehicleAccelerationsReward**: lower_is_better  
  Rationale: Moderated accelerations prevent aggressive driving, aligning with cooperative behavior.

- **MeanAllVehicleSpeedsReward**: higher_is_better  
  Rationale: Higher average speeds suggest smoother traffic flow for all vehicles, contributing to the overall traffic system efficiency.

- **SafetyHeadwayFailureReward**: higher_is_better  
  Rationale: Higher values indicate safer headway distances maintained and fewer failures, promoting safety.

- **MinimumEgoSpeedsReward**: lower_is_better  
  Rationale: Accept slower minimum speeds of autonomous vehicles if it enhances safety and reduces disruption, aligning with cooperative behavior.

- **MinimumHeadwaysReward**: higher_is_better  
  Rationale: Larger minimum headway distances contribute to safety by ensuring safer distances.

- **MaximumAllVehicleSpeedsReward**: lower_is_better  
  Rationale: Lower maximum speeds minimize speed limit violations, promoting overall traffic safety and control.

- **FailureCountReward**: lower_is_better  
  Rationale: Lower values indicate fewer failures or collisions, enhancing safety.

- **SpeedExceedanceReward**: lower_is_better  
  Rationale: Lower counts of vehicles exceeding the target velocity ensure controlled and safe traffic speeds, minimizing disruption.

By aligning the preference directions as indicated, the outcomes can be evaluated to ensure safety, smooth flow, and cooperative engagement of autonomous vehicles within the traffic system.
