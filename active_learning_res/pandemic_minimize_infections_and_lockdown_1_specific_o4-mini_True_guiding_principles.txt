**Stakeholder Goals and Principles:**

1. **Goal to Minimize Infections and Critical Cases**: Focus on reducing the number of infected and critical cases to improve health outcomes.

2. **Lockdown Stage Minimization**: Aim for the least restrictive lockdown stage while still managing the pandemic effectively.

3. **Exclusion of Other Objectives**: Only consider the sum of infections and critical cases, and lockdown stage for evaluation. Other objectives are not relevant.

**Guiding Principles Aligned with Stakeholder Goals:**

1. **Infections and Critical Cases Minimization**:
   - Prefer outcomes where the "SumInfectedAndCriticalReward" and "SumCriticalCasesReward" are less negative. This indicates a lower sum of infected and critical cases over time.
   - Lower "MaxCriticalCasesReward" values should also be prioritized, as they indicate a reduction in the peak demand on healthcare systems.

2. **Prioritize Health Outcomes**:
   - Priority should be given to reducing infections, critical cases, and healthcare strain even if it means maintaining or increasing the lockdown stage.
   - The principle of "Infections and Critical Cases Priority" is paramount; a decrease in these numbers strictly improves the outcome, regardless of lockdown stages.

3. **Balanced Lockdown Stage**:
   - Favor outcomes where the lockdown stage, as measured by "Stage0Reward", "Stage1Reward", "Stage2Reward", "Stage3Reward", or "Stage4Reward", is higher (i.e., less restrictive), provided it does not lead to a significant increase in infections and critical cases.
   - Consider higher lockdown stages only when necessary to control the pandemic effectively and balance health outcomes as per "Lockdown Stage Trade-off".

4. **Exclusion of Unrelated Objectives**:
   - Disregard the "SumDeathsReward", "SumICUCriticalCasesReward", "SumRecoveriesReward", "InfectionAboveThresholdReward", "MinRecoveryReward", and "InfectionVarianceReward". These do not directly impact the evaluation of the desired outcomes focused on infection control and lockdown minimization.

5. **Strategic Flexibility**:
   - Maintain flexibility in approach by adjusting lockdown stages dynamically to achieve the dual goals of reducing infections and minimizing restrictions.
   - Regularly monitor the effectiveness of restrictions and be ready to shift stages in response to changes in infection and critical case trends, ensuring alignment with both health and social objectives.

These principles guide the decision-making process in the synthetic environment, ensuring alignment with the priority of minimizing infections and critical healthcare cases while striving to achieve the lowest feasible lockdown stage.
