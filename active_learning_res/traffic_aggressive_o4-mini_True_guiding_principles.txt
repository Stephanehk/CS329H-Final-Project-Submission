**Stakeholder Goals and Principles:**

**Goal:**
1. Maximize the traffic flow and speed of the autonomous vehicles being controlled. Give no regard to the other vehicles on the road.

**Principles to State:**
- **Autonomous Vehicle Dominance:** Any increase in traffic flow and speed of the autonomous vehicles strictly improves the outcome, regardless of other objectives. The other vehicles on the road are not important.
- **No Courtesy Constraint:** Lane changes, merging, and overtaking maneuvers that benefit autonomous vehicles are always preferred, even if they slow down or inconvenience other vehicles.

**Patterns to Watch Out For:**

1. **Autonomous Speed and Flow Maximization:** Ensure that the solutions prioritize increases in mean and minimum speeds of the autonomous vehicles.
2. **Neglect of Non-Autonomous Vehicle Metrics:** While other vehicles' performance metrics might be present, they should not influence the evaluation unless they directly impact the performance of autonomous vehicles.
3. **Safety Concerns Balanced with Speed:** Although the focus is on speed, some attention must be given to safety headways to prevent scenarios that might lead to autonomous vehicle failures, minimizing potential slowdowns.

**Guiding Principles to Evaluate Outcomes:**

1. **Maximize MeanEgoSpeedsReward and MinimumEgoSpeedsReward:**
   - Higher values signify better performance. Focus on achieving the highest possible speeds for ego vehicles to maximize overall traffic flow.

2. **Promote MeanAllVehicleSpeedsReward:**
   - While focusing on autonomous vehicles, generally higher values may indicate smoother integration into traffic, indirectly easing ego vehicle acceleration efforts.

3. **Minimize FailureCountReward:**
   - Aim for 0 as failures (collisions or breakdowns) will severely impact the speed and flow of autonomous vehicles, thus reducing overall performance.

4. **Encourage MeanEgoVehicleAccelerationsReward Appropriately:**
   - Higher, yet controlled accelerations are acceptable as long as they result in better speeds without increasing the risk of failures.

5. **Achieve Positive MeanHeadwaysReward and MinimumHeadwaysReward:**
   - Maintain sufficient headways to prevent accidents that could impede ego vehicle traffic flow. This is a secondary consideration to maximizing speed but cannot be ignored completely.

6. **Assess SafetyHeadwayFailureReward Positively:**
   - A more positive value indicates reduced penalties from failures and sufficient headways, aiding uninterrupted high-speed maintenance.

7. **Manage MaximumAllVehicleSpeedsReward and SpeedExceedanceReward:**
   - Keep within reasonable limits to prevent legal repercussions that could eventually constraint autonomous vehicle operations, but only as a secondary concern to maximizing ego vehicle performance.

By following these guiding principles, evaluations remain aligned with the stakeholder's focus on prioritizing autonomous vehicle speed and flow in traffic situations, respecting the dominance principle and lack of courtesy constraint.
